# TI-84 Plus CE Numerical Methods

This folder contains two types of TI-84 Plus CE programs:

### 1. equations/
Programs that display the core formulas for numerical linear algebra
methods. These are for studying, reference, and viewing the iteration steps.

### 2. solvers/
Programs that perform the actual numerical iterations to solve **Ax = b**.

All programs are written in TI-BASIC and compatible with the TI-84 Plus CE or any
calculator/emulator that supports .8xp program files.
